# Bitcoin Wallets

An index of Bitcoin wallets that support connecting to your own Bitcoin node (via RPC) or your own Electrum server (such as Fulcrum). Each entry lists supported platforms, connection method, Tor support, and links to upstream documentation.

For Lightning wallets that connect to your own LND or Core Lightning node, see [Lightning Wallets](lightning-wallets.md).

## Connection Methods

There are two ways a wallet can connect to your self-hosted Bitcoin infrastructure:

- **Bitcoin RPC** — The wallet connects directly to your Bitcoin node using its JSON-RPC interface. This gives the wallet full access to your node's blockchain data without any additional indexing service.
- **Electrum server** — The wallet connects to an Electrum-protocol server (such as Fulcrum) that sits in front of your Bitcoin node. The Electrum server indexes the blockchain and provides fast address lookups. Most wallets use this method.
