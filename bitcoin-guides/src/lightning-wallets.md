# Lightning Wallets

An index of Lightning wallets and management tools that support connecting to your own LND or Core Lightning node. This includes both native apps (mobile/desktop) and web-based tools that can be self-hosted or installed as services on StartOS.

For on-chain Bitcoin wallets that connect to your own Bitcoin node or Electrum server, see [Bitcoin Wallets](bitcoin-wallets.md).

## Node Implementations

The wallets and tools below connect to one or more of these Lightning node implementations:

- **LND** — The most widely supported implementation. Wallets connect via its REST or gRPC API using a macaroon for authentication. LND also supports [Lightning Node Connect (LNC)](#lightning-node-connect), a secure remote connection method that works without opening ports or using Tor.
- **Core Lightning (CLN)** — Blockstream's implementation. Wallets connect via CLNRest (the built-in REST plugin) or gRPC.
- **Eclair** — ACINQ's implementation. Fewer wallets support it directly.

### Lightning Node Connect

Lightning Node Connect (LNC) is a connection protocol by Lightning Labs that lets you securely reach your LND node from anywhere without opening ports or configuring Tor. It works by establishing an end-to-end encrypted connection through a relay server using a short pairing phrase. LNC requires [Lightning Terminal (litd)](#lightning-terminal) running alongside your LND node.

LNC is supported by [Zeus](#zeus) and [Lightning Terminal's web UI](https://terminal.lightning.engineering/).

## Native Apps

### BitBanana

- **Platforms:** Android
- **Connects to:** LND, Core Lightning
- **Tor:** Yes — native Tor support

BitBanana is the actively maintained successor to the Zap Android wallet. It connects to LND via lndconnect URI (REST) and to Core Lightning via cln-grpc. Supports BOLT 12, coin control, and NFC.

- [Connect a Lightning node](https://docs.bitbanana.app/setup/connect-a-lightning-node)

### BlueWallet

- **Platforms:** Android, iOS
- **Connects to:** LND (via LNDHub)
- **Tor:** Yes — available in network settings

BlueWallet connects to LND through LNDHub, a middleware layer that sits on top of your LND node and provides account-based access. This makes it good for multi-user setups where one node serves several wallets. LNDHub requires LND and Redis as dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
>
> BlueWallet shut down their hosted custodial LNDHub service in 2023, but the self-hosted open-source LNDHub software still works. You can also use the LNDHub extension in LNbits as an alternative backend.

### FullyNoded

- **Platforms:** iOS, macOS
- **Connects to:** LND, Core Lightning
- **Tor:** Yes — Tor is a core design principle; all connections route through Tor

FullyNoded is primarily a Bitcoin wallet, but also supports connecting to LND (via REST over Tor) and Core Lightning. Apple ecosystem only.

- [Lightning documentation](https://fonta1n3.github.io/FullyNoded/Docs/Lightning.html)

### Zeus

- **Platforms:** Android, iOS
- **Connects to:** LND, Core Lightning, Eclair, LNDHub
- **Tor:** Yes — native on Android; experimental on iOS

Zeus is the most versatile mobile Lightning wallet, supporting three node implementations plus LNDHub accounts. It connects to LND via REST or [Lightning Node Connect (LNC)](#lightning-node-connect), Core Lightning via CLNRest, and Eclair via REST. Zeus can also run an embedded LND node on-device without a remote connection.
