# Archival vs Pruned Nodes

A Bitcoin node can store the entire blockchain (archival) or only a subset of it (pruned). Both modes fully validate every block and transaction — the difference is how much historical data the node keeps on disk after validation. StartOS supports both modes and includes a feature that makes pruned nodes more capable than they are on other platforms.

## Archival Nodes

An archival node keeps every block ever produced, from the genesis block to the current tip. Nothing is deleted after validation.

**Advantages:**

- **Serves any historical block** — Other software that needs old blocks (block explorers, chain analysis tools) can fetch them directly from your node.
- **Supports block explorers** — Services like Mempool require access to the full blockchain history and only work with archival nodes.
- **Reindex without re-download** — If you need to rebuild internal databases, the node can reindex from its local copy of the chain.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Disk usage** — The full blockchain is over 600 GB and growing. You need a drive large enough to hold it plus room for continued growth.

## Pruned Nodes

A pruned node validates every block but discards block data after processing, keeping only a subset of blocks rather than the full chain. The node retains the full UTXO set (the record of all unspent coins), so it can still validate new blocks and transactions.

**Advantages:**

- **Much less disk space** — A pruned node can run with as little as 5-10 GB of block data, compared to 600+ GB for an archival node.
- **Same security** — Pruned nodes validate everything. They enforce the same consensus rules as archival nodes.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Cannot serve old blocks** — On most platforms, if a service requests a block the node has already pruned, the request fails. StartOS solves this with [on-demand block fetching](#pruned-nodes-on-startos).
- **No block explorers** — Services like Mempool that need full blockchain history will not work with a pruned node, even on StartOS.

## Pruned Nodes on StartOS

On most platforms, running a pruned node introduces a practical limitation: downstream services like LND or BTCPay Server need to control which blocks are kept and which are pruned. Each service tells the node "don't prune blocks newer than X" to ensure the blocks it cares about remain available. This works fine with a single downstream service, but breaks down when multiple services each want to control pruning — they can conflict over which blocks to keep.

StartOS solves this with **on-demand block fetching**. The Bitcoin package on StartOS integrates btc-rpc-proxy, which intercepts block requests from downstream services. If a service asks for a block the pruned node has already discarded, btc-rpc-proxy fetches that block from the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network on the fly and serves it to the requesting service. From the service's perspective, it appears to be talking to an archival node.

This means:

- **Multiple downstream services work simultaneously** — LND, BTCPay Server, Fulcrum, and any other service can all connect to a single pruned node without conflict.
- **No manual pruning management** — You don't need to coordinate which blocks each service needs. btc-rpc-proxy handles it transparently.
- **Significant disk savings** — You get most of the benefits of an archival node with a fraction of the disk usage.

> [!NOTE]
>
> On-demand block fetching adds a small delay when a service requests a pruned block, since the block must be downloaded from the network before it can be served. In practice this is rare — most services only need recent blocks during normal operation.

## Which Should You Choose?

For most StartOS users, a **pruned node** is the best choice. Thanks to on-demand block fetching, you get compatibility with all major downstream services while using a fraction of the disk space.

Choose an **archival node** if:

- You want to run a **block explorer** like Mempool — this is the one major use case that requires full historical block data and cannot be served by on-demand fetching.
- You have the disk space and prefer having a complete local copy of the blockchain for its own sake.
