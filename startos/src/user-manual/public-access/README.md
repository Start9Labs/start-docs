# Public Access

Public access means making your services reachable by anyone on the Internet.

- [Clearnet](./clearnet.md). Host services on the public Internet using standard (`.com`, `.net`, etc) domains or public IP addresses.

- [Tor](./tor.md). Host services as `.onion` addresses for censorship resistance and optional anonymity.
