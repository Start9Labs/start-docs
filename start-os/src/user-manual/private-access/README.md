# Private Access

Private access means only you and people you explicitly authorize can reach your server. There are four methods available, each with different use cases and tradeoffs.

- [LAN](./lan.md). Same local network. The fastest connection method. Uses mDNS or IP address.

- [VPN](./vpn.md). Fast, private, _personal_ access from anywhere in the world using a VPN server running on your router or VPS.

- [Tor](./tor.md). Anonymous `.onion` addresses on the private Internet. Requires installing the Tor service from the marketplace.

- [Holesail](./holesail.md). Direct, encrypted peer-to-peer tunnels with no port forwarding or static IP required. Requires installing the Holesail service from the marketplace.
